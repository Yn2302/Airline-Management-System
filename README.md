# Airline-Management-System
Design and implement a database application using the MySQL Relational Database Management System

# Phase 1
Develop an Extended/Enhanced Entity-Relationship Diagram (EERD) based on the provided project requirements. The EERD must follow these specifications and guidelines:
1. Your EERD must reflect the requirements presented in the scenario description as completely as reasonably possible using the EERD modeling features mentioned below.
2. Include strong entities; candidate (full) and partial keys (i.e., discriminants); weak entities & identifying relationships; one-to-one, one-to-many and many-to-many binary relationships with combinations of total and partial participation; ternary relationships; attributes of varying types (e.g., simple, composite, multivalued, derived); superclass & subclass (i.e., is-a) relationships; and union relationships

# Phase 2
Develop a set of Relational Schema and SQL Physical Schema based on a provided EERD; also, transform and upload a provided dataset into your database.
1. Translate the given EERD into a set of relational schema and identify primary keys, discriminants, and foreign keys
3. Translate the relational schema into create table statements with the appropriate data types, primary and unique keys, and foreign keys and including domain constraints, integrity constraints, primary keys and uniqueness constraints, and foreign key constraints
5. Write insert statements to import the initial data into the tables you've created
6. Document all unhandled constraints based on your design & implementation choices

# Phase 3
Develop the Structured Query Language (SQL) views, queries and transactions needed to support an application based on a provided database and dataset.
1. Implement thirteen (13) stored procedures which allow the system operators to query and modify the database state in accordance with the problem scenario
2. Implement six (6) views which provide information to the system operators about the database state from various "points of view" (i.e., system operator roles)
